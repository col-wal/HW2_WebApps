      alt="January Day at Smokehole Canyon">
      <p>Approximately two and half hours aways from grounds is Smoke Hole Canyon, 
          West Virginia, a location where members of the highlining community 
          regularly meet up to rig 50m to 120m+ highlines approximately 200 feet off the ground.
          The highline span the edges of the cliffs providing beautiful views of
          the valley below, wonderful sunsets, and lots of exposure. A few members
          of the club achieved their goals of standing up for the first time at Smoke 
          Hole Canyon. It is an unforgettable trip!

      <h3>Summersville Lake</h3>
      <img class="about-image" src="pictures/summersville.png" 
      alt="Midline at Summersville Lake, WV">
      <p>The New River Gorge area of West Virginia is widely known for its plethora
          of world-class rock climbing and whitewater. However, it is less known for its 
          incredible highline potential. Specifically, at Summersville Lake there are many
          bolts to rig highlines over the water. The lake is one of the most popular places
          for highlining in the area and offers lots of other fun activities such as 
          cliff jumping, climbing, and boating.

      <h3>Four Moons Slackline Preserve - Seneca Rocks, WV</h3>
      <img class="about-image" src="pictures/roysgap.png" 
      alt="350m Highline at Roy's Gap">
      <p>Four Moons is a piece of property located right next to Seneca 
          Rocks National Recreation Area in Seneca Rocks West Virginia. Depending
          on the time of year, there is multitude of permanently rigged highlines 
          setup that people can pay a small fee, or a yearly membership, to come use. 
          It is one of the only places of its kind in the world and allows the activity
          to be both accessible and time-efficient, as you don't have to spend the time 
          of rigging the lines when you go.

      <h3>The Likely Future</h3>
      <img class="about-image" src="pictures/whiteoak.jpg" 
      alt="Whiteoak Canyon in Shennandoah National Park">
      <p>The club has plans to scout out new locations for setting up midlines and 
          highlines, like Whiteoak Canyon in Shennandoah National Park, so stay on the lookout for trips mentioned in the GroupMe!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-container">
      <h3>Around Grounds</h3>
      <p>It is nice to not have to drive multiple hours to setup and practice highline. 
          The club will setup midlines, or less high highlines, in the Greater Charlottesville
          Area, in places such as Observatory Hill Woods, the Rivanna River, and various places
          around grounds. Communication is handled through the GroupMe. These trips
          are great opportunities for members of the club to get outside of their comfort zone
          and get more experience with the sport
