      <p> Practices are typically held on the South Lawn, on the opposite end, 
          of the Rotunda, at UVA, typically every Wednesday. The time and day 
          of the week of practices is variable and changes on a semester
          basis. For information regarding practices please refer to the GroupMe 
          or reach out to Santiago or Colin with questions. Typically, there's will be 
          three to five (or more) lines setup at each practice ranging from beginner
          to advanced. All are welcome to join. No experience is necessary and beginners
          are strongly encouraged to participate and come hang out. Don't let the word 
          "practice" scare you away. We will have music, hacky sacks, juggling balls, music,
          blankets and lots of good times.
